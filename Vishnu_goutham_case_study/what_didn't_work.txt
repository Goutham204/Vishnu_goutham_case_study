1. OpenAI API quota was exhausted – could not use GPT-based LLMs live.
2. Pydantic AI is not publicly available – fallback to custom Python classes and functions.
3. TextBlob failed to capture strong emotional tone like “completely broken” (SUP-001).
4. Initial routing logic missed “feature request” in SUP-003 – routed to support instead of product.
5. SUP-005 (security issue) incorrectly routed to engineering at first – needed escalation.
6. Initial urgency detection was too shallow – had to improve keyword coverage.
7. Neutral sentiment was returned for several clearly negative tickets – LLMs would perform better.
8. Lack of LLM means no reasoning or context-based routing, only keyword patterning.
