Designed two agents: Sentiment Agent and Routing Agent.
Originally planned to use OpenAI API with structured prompts via pydantic_ai.
Encountered OpenAI quota exhaustion.
Pivoted to an offline implementation using TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment was extracted using rule-based keyword matching.
Routing Agent used message content, urgency, and metadata to assign team and priority.

Testing

Used the 5 case study tickets from the challenge PDF as test input.
Iterated on sentiment and routing logic after reviewing outputs.
Added more keywords to better detect urgency and intent.
Verified routing for each case and adjusted logic where needed.
Built fallback-friendly code that works even without internet or LLMs.
